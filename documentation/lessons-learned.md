# Lessons Learned

## Background
I began learning Linux in June 2024, and this project has served as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding while preparing for the RHCSA certification. Prior to this, I had no experience with GitHub, scripting, or programming. The project has been a fun and rewarding experiment, pushing me outside my comfort zone and giving me practical experience in areas I was unfamiliar with.

This project is constantly evolving as I learn new concepts and techniques, and I am always open to feedback and suggestions from the community.
