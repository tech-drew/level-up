# Lessons Learned

## Background
I began learning Linux in June 2024, and this project has served as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding while preparing for the RHCSA certification. Prior to this, I had no experience with GitHub, scripting, or programming. The project has been a fun and rewarding experiment, pushing me outside my comfort zone and giving me practical experience and skills in areas I was unfamiliar with.

This project is constantly evolving as I learn new concepts and techniques, and I am always open to feedback and suggestions from the community.

The following sections summarize the main lessons and skills I gained throughout this project.

## Key Takeaways

### Version Control and GitHub
- **Branches:** Using branches effectively to manage features, bug fixes, and experiments.  
- **Frequent Commits:** Committing changes regularly to maintain a clean history.  
- **Changelog:** Maintaining a changelog to document project changes over time.  
- **GitHub Workflow:** Gained practical knowledge of push, pull, commit, managing issues, and setting up private repositories.  
- **Best Practices:** Learned about semantic versioning, naming conventions for branches, and file organization.  

### Programming and Scripting
- **Scripting Basics:** Developed fundamental scripting skills to automate tasks.  
- **Programming Fundamentals:** Learned core programming concepts and how they apply in real-world projects.  
- **Heredocs:** Gained experience using heredocs for structured text and scripts.  

### Linux and System Administration
- **Linux Skills:** Improved command-line proficiency and system administration knowledge.  
- **Boot Time Optimization:** Learned techniques to reduce startup time and improve system performance.  
- **Theming and Fonts:** I initially started this project on Fedora Server and attempted to add fonts and a theme manager from scratch, which led to dependency issues and a complex setup. To resolve these challenges, I rebuilt the project on Fedora KDE Plasma. Switching to Fedora KDE Plasma provided built-in theming tools and preconfigured font management, which reduced dependency issues and simplified configuration. This experience reinforced that theming and font management can be far more complicated than they initially appear.

### Automation, Security, and Project Management
- **Basic Automation:** Implemented scripts and routines to streamline repetitive tasks.  
- **Security Practices:** Learned foundational security practices for project safety and integrity.  
- **Licensing:** Gained awareness of software licensing and the importance of choosing the right license for a project.

## Future Goals
- Improve and expand project widgets for better usability and customization.
- Enhance install.sh with a dry-run option and add clear code comments to make installation safer and more understandable.
- Explore advanced scripting and automation to streamline repetitive tasks.
- Experiment with Podman containers and integrate them into project workflows.
- Investigate lightweight animated wallpapers and their system impact.
- Learn about workflows, including GitHub Actions, to automate project tasks.
- Establish clear security guidelines for the project and follow best practices.
