# Logging Locations and Troubleshooting for Level-Up

This document explains the various log files generated during the **Level-Up installation** and **Level-Up sessions**. Understanding these logs will help you monitor the installation, troubleshoot issues, and ensure everything is working smoothly.

---

### 1. **Installer Log (`level-up-install.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/level-up-install.log`
   - **Description**: This log file contains the output from the main installation script (`install.sh`). It records the installation of required packages, enabling of repositories, copying of configuration files, and other actions taken during the installation.
   - **Use Case**: Check this log for information on what happened during the installation process, including any errors that may have occurred while installing software or copying files.

### 2. **Dry-Run Installer Log (`level-up-install-dryrun.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/level-up-install-dryrun.log`
   - **Description**: This log is generated when running the script in **dry-run mode** (`./install.sh --dry-run`). It simulates the installation, printing what would happen without making any changes to the system.
   - **Use Case**: Use this log to review which actions would be performed if the script were run normally. This is useful for testing the installation without making actual changes to your system.

### 3. **Hyprland Log (`hyprland.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/hyprland.log`
   - **Description**: This log captures the output from the `hyprland` session, including debug information, errors, and status updates.
   - **Use Case**: Check this log for issues related to the Hyprland session itself, such as crashes, performance issues, or initialization problems. It’s also useful for monitoring Hyprland’s behavior and troubleshooting session startup issues.

   **Log Levels:**
   - `0`: Errors only (Minimal log output)
   - `1`: Warnings
   - `2`: Info (General informational messages)
   - `3`: Debug (Verbose logging for detailed troubleshooting)
   - `trace`: Extremely verbose, detailed logging (Use with caution, generates large amounts of data)

   You can adjust the logging level by editing the `loglevel` in your `hyprland.conf`. By default, the log file will be located in `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/hyprland.log`.

### 4. **Waybar Log (`waybar.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/waybar.log`
   - **Description**: This log captures the output from the Waybar status bar, including debugging information and errors related to its initialization and operation.
   - **Use Case**: Review this log if you experience issues with Waybar (e.g., it’s not launching or displaying correctly), or if you need to troubleshoot Waybar-related problems in the Hyprland session.

   **Log Levels:**
   - `error`: Logs errors only
   - `warn`: Logs warnings
   - `info`: Logs general information
   - `debug`: Logs detailed debug info
   - `trace`: Extremely verbose logs, including all internal operations

   You can adjust the logging level by modifying the `logging` section in your Waybar config file (`~/.config/waybar/config.json`). The default log level is typically `info`, but you can set it to `debug` or `trace` if you need more detailed logs for troubleshooting.

### 5. **Launch Hyprland with Logging (`launch-hyprland-with-logging.sh`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/launch-hyprland-with-logging.log` (or your defined log location)
   - **Description**: This log is generated by the `launch-hyprland-with-logging.sh` script, which starts the Hyprland session with logging enabled. It contains information on the execution of the script itself, including any initialization steps and errors encountered when launching Hyprland.
   - **Use Case**: This log is useful for troubleshooting the launch process of Hyprland. If Hyprland doesn’t start or you encounter issues during session startup, check this log for any errors or missing dependencies.

### 6. **Launch Waybar with Logging (`launch-waybar-with-logging.sh`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/launch-waybar-with-logging.log` (or your defined log location)
   - **Description**: This log is generated by the `launch-waybar-with-logging.sh` script, which starts the Waybar process with logging enabled. It captures the output from the Waybar launch process, including any errors or initialization problems.
   - **Use Case**: This log is helpful if Waybar fails to launch, or if there are issues with its configuration or output during the session.

### General Notes:
- **Where to find logs**: All log files are stored in the directory `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/`.
- **When to check the logs**: You should review the logs if you encounter any issues during installation (`install.sh` logs), window manager behavior (`hyprland` logs), or status bar functionality (`waybar` logs).
- **Log rotation**: Depending on how much logging is done, log files might grow over time. Make sure to monitor them if you're using `trace` level logging for development purposes.

### Example Usage of `logging-locations-and-troubleshooting.md`:
- **Troubleshooting**: If you run into issues after logging into the `Level-Up` session, you might check the **`level-up-install.log`** for installation problems, **`hyprland.log`** for Hyprland session issues, and **`waybar.log`** for problems related to Waybar.
- **Debugging**: If the installation or session startup fails, check the **dry-run log** to verify what changes would have been made, and compare that with the actual output in the logs for any discrepancies.
- **Post-installation Help**: After installation, users can check the logs to verify that the system was set up correctly and all components (Hyprland, Waybar, etc.) are functioning as expected.
