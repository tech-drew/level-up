# Logging Locations and Troubleshooting for Level-Up

This document explains the various log files generated during the **Level-Up installation** and **Level-Up sessions**. Understanding these logs will help you monitor the installation, troubleshoot issues, and ensure everything is working smoothly.

---

### 1. **Installer Log (`level-up-install.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/level-up-install.log`
   - **Description**: This log file contains the output from the main installation script (`install.sh`). It records the installation of required packages, enabling of repositories, copying of configuration files, and other actions taken during the installation.

### 2. **Dry-Run Installer Log (`level-up-install-dryrun.log`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/level-up-install-dryrun.log`
   - **Description**: This log is generated when running the script in **dry-run mode** (`./install.sh --dry-run`). It simulates the installation, printing what would happen without making any changes to the system.

### 3. **Launch Hyprland with Logging (`launch-hyprland-with-logging.sh`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/logs/launch-hyprland-with-logging.log` (or your defined log location)
   - **Description**: This log is generated by the `launch-hyprland-with-logging.sh` script, which starts the Level-Up session. It contains information on the execution of the script itself, including any initialization steps and errors encountered when launching Level-Up.
   - **Note** The launch hyprland with logging collects minimal logs. Detailed hyprland logs can be found using the information here. https://wiki.hypr.land/Crashes-and-Bugs/
   
### 4. **Launch Waybar with Logging (`launch-waybar-with-logging.sh`)**
   - **Location**: `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/logs/launch-waybar-with-logging.log` (or your defined log location)
   - **Description**: This log is generated by the `launch-waybar-with-logging.sh` script, which starts the Waybar process with logging enabled. It captures the output from the Waybar launch process, including any errors or initialization problems.

### General Notes:
- **Where to find logs**: All log files are stored in the directory `$HOME/.local/share/level-up/logs/`.
- **When to check the logs**: You should review the logs if you encounter any issues during installation (`install.sh` logs), window manager behavior (`launch-hyprland-with-logging` logs), or status bar functionality (`launch-waybar-with-logging` logs).
- **Log rotation**: Depending on how much logging is done, log files might grow over time. This project does not have any built in functionality to delete log files.
