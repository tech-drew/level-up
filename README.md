# Level-Up

**Level-Up** is a lightweight and minimal desktop environment built on **Fedora Linux**, using **Hyprland** as the dynamic window manager. It comes preconfigured with a curated set of tools and aesthetic customizations, including **Waybar**, **Alacritty**, **Fastfetch**, **Dolphin**, and more.

The design philosophy is intentionally minimal. I personally navigate almost entirely via Hyprland keyboard shortcuts and the terminal. The Waybar is typically hidden in my workflow — I only bring it up when I need something specific.

> Linux is about making your computer work for you.  
> This configuration is meant to be a starting point, not a final product. Feel free to try it out, tweak it, and make Level-Up your own.

## Work in Progress

I'm still new to Linux and learning as I go. This setup is the result of tinkering, curiosity, and a desire to build something that feels right.  
Expect updates and improvements over time as I continue to explore and grow. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
