# Level-Up

**Level-Up** is a customizable desktop environment built on **Fedora 42 KDE Plasma Desktop Edition**, featuring **Hyprland** as the dynamic window manager. It comes preconfigured with a curated set of tools and aesthetic customizations, including **Waybar**, **Alacritty**, **Fastfetch**, **Dolphin**, and more.

> Linux is about making your computer work for you.  
> This configuration is meant to be a starting point, not a final product. Feel free to try it out, tweak it, and make Level-Up your own.

## Project Status: Work in Progress

This project is under development and evolving as I learn and grow. Features may change over time, and feedback is welcome.

I started learning Linux in June 2025, and this project serves as a hands-on way to deepen my Linux knowledge. Prior to working on this project I had no experience in GitHub, scripting, or programming.

For a detailed summary of the skills, challenges, and lessons I learned while building this project, see the [Lessons Learned](docs/lessons-learned.md) document.
