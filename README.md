Level-Up: A Minimal Fedora Desktop with Hyprland

**Level-Up** is a lightweight and minimal desktop environment built on **Fedora Linux**, using **Hyprland** as the dynamic window manager. It comes preconfigured with a curated set of tools and aesthetic customizations, including **Waybar**, **Alacritty**, **Fastfetch**, **Dolphin**, and more.

The design philosophy is intentionally minimal. I personally navigate almost entirely via Hyprland keyboard shortcuts and the terminal. The Waybar is typically hidden in my workflow — I only bring it up when I need something specific.

> 💡 **Linux is about making your computer work for you.**
> This configuration is meant to be a starting point, not a final product. Feel free to try it out, tweak it, and make Level-Up your own.

### 🚧 Still a Work in Progress

I'm still new to Linux and learning as I go. This setup is the result of tinkering, curiosity, and a desire to build something that *feels right*. Expect updates and improvements over time as I continue to explore and grow. **Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!**

## 🎛️ Customization Tips

Most key config files are bound to Hyprland shortcuts for quick editing:

| Keybinding          | Opens...               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Super + A`         | Alacritty config       |
| `Super + Shift + A` | Alacritty color scheme |
| `Super + H`         | Hyprland config        |
| `Super + W`         | Waybar config          |
| `Super + Shift + W` | Waybar styles          |

> Tip: You can find and change these bindings in the `hyprland.conf` file.
