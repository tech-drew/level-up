After installing Level-Up, you may want to learn more about Linux or install Nvidia drivers. Below are some trusted resources to help you on your Linux journey.

- Hyprland Wiki  
  https://wiki.hypr.land/  
  The official Hyprland documentation. Highly recommended for learning about configuration options, environment variables, animation settings, and troubleshooting.

- NVIDIA Driver Installation Guide for Fedora  
  https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2015/fedora-nvidia-guide/#11-check-is-your-nvidia-card-supported  
  A well-maintained guide for installing proprietary NVIDIA drivers on Fedora. Use this if you're running an NVIDIA GPU and need reliable Wayland support.

- Arch Wiki  
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page
  The official documentation for Arch Linux. Although this project is built on Fedora, the Arch Wiki contains extensive, well-maintained information applicable to Linux systems in general. It is an excellent resource for learning about system configuration, troubleshooting, and Linux concepts.

- Gentoo Wiki
  https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page
  The official documentation for Gentoo Linux. While Gentoo is built and configured differently from Fedora, the Gentoo Wiki provides deeply technical, well-maintained information that is often useful beyond Gentoo itself. It is an excellent resource for understanding Linux internals, system configuration, package management concepts, and source-based workflows
