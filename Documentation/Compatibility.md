### Compatibility Notice

---

**Level-Up is only supported on a clean installation of Fedora 42 KDE Plasma Desktop Edition.**

### Supported:
- Fedora 42 KDE Plasma Desktop Edition (clean install only)

It is strongly recommended to create a bootable Fedora 42 KDE Plasma USB using Fedora Media Writer. While other tools such as Rufus, Etcher, or UNetbootin can sometimes work, they may not properly write Fedora’s hybrid ISO image format. As a result, USBs created with these tools might not boot or install Fedora correctly. Fedora Media Writer is the officially supported tool and ensures reliable image verification and compatibility.

**Note:** Hyprland is not optimized for use in virtual machines and may not function properly without direct access to a physical GPU. Virtual machines typically use virtualized graphics, which do not provide the same performance or compatibility required by Wayland compositors like Hyprland. While it may be possible to run Hyprland in a VM with GPU passthrough, this is an advanced configuration and is not recommended for general use. For optimal performance, this setup should only be installed on real hardware with direct access to a physical GPU.
